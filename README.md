### Developers log

10/7 2018:
- Need to refactor this project. Have a faint idea on what to do, mainly connecting it to Gist, reading and writing new gists.
- Frontend should be a form with codelinting (if possible) and styling of code as in editors.
- backend will be gist github api, frontend needs to create a file on the fly to post to api.




Happy coding!
